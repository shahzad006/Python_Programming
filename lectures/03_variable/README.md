## 1. What Are Variables?
**Definition**
- A variable is a container that temporarily stores data during the execution of a program.
- The value stored in a variable can change during the program's execution, which is why it is called a "variable."

**Example**
- Imagine a glass of water. The glass is the container, and the water is the data stored in it.
- Similarly, in programming, a variable acts as a container that holds data temporarily.



## 2. Rules for Naming Variables
**Key Rules**

- **Start with a Letter or Underscore**: Variable names must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
Example: username, _firstname

- **Cannot Start with a Number**: Variable names cannot begin with a digit.
Example: 1user is invalid, but user1 is valid.

- **Use Only Letters, Numbers, and Underscores**: Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
Example: user_name, age1

- **Case-Sensitive**: Variable names are case-sensitive.
Example: FirstName and firstname are considered two different variables.

- **Avoid Reserved Words**: Do not use Pythonâ€™s reserved keywords (e.g., print, if, for) as variable names.
Example: print = 10 is invalid because print is a reserved word.

- **Meaningful Names**: Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables to improve code readability.
Example: Use student_name instead of sn.



## 3. Variable Naming Conventions

1. **Snake Case**: All letters are in lowercase, and words are separated by underscores.
Example: user_name, first_name.
2. **Camel Case**: The first word is in lowercase, and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.
Example: userName, firstName.
3. **Pascal Case**: The first letter of each word is capitalized, and there are no separators.
Example: UserName, FirstName.

## 5. Data Types in Python

1. Integer
 - Represents whole numbers (positive or negative) without decimal points.
 - Example: 10, -5, 1000.

2. Float
 - Represents decimal numbers (positive or negative).
 - Example: 3.14, -0.001.

3. String 
 - Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.
 - Example: 'hello', "python".

4. Boolean
 - Represents two values: True or False.
 - Used in conditions and logical operations.
 - Example: is_student = True.
