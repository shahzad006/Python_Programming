# Python Operators

## ðŸ§® What Are Python Operators?
Python operators are special symbols or words that perform operations on variables and values. Think of them as tools to do math, compare values, or combine logic.

## ðŸ”¹ Types of Python Operators
1. Arithmetic
	Do math (add, subtract, multiply, etc.)
    	`+`, `-`, `*`

2. Assignment

    	`=`, `+=`, `-=`

3. Comparison 
    Compare values (True/False)
    	`==`, `!=`, `>` , `<=`

4. Logical
    Combine conditions (True/False logic)
    	`and`, `or`, `not`

5. Bitwise
    Work on bits (0s and 1s)
    	`&`, `

6. Membership
	Check if a value is in a sequence
    	`in`, `not in`

7. Identity
